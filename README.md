# Face Recognition Project
## Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system detects and recognizes faces in real-time from a webcam feed. The custom CNN model is trained on a dataset of face images and can accurately identify individuals from the given dataset.

## Project Description
The face recognition project leverages the power of OpenCV for face detection and a custom CNN model for face recognition. The system captures video feed from a webcam, detects faces in each frame, and matches them against a pre-trained database of known faces. The custom CNN model is designed and trained to achieve high accuracy in recognizing faces from the dataset.

## Features
Real-time face detection and recognition.
Uses OpenCV for efficient face detection.
Custom CNN model for high accuracy in face recognition.
Easy-to-follow procedure for training and testing the model.
Scalable and extendable for larger datasets and more complex applications.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow/Keras (for building and training the CNN model)
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
